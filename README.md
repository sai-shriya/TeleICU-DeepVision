<h1 align="center">TeleICU-DeepVision</h1>

<p align="center">This repository is for a project aimed at enhancing TeleICU systems. The solution uses deep learning and video processing to recognize different people in the ICU room and detect patient movements. This helps remote healthcare professionals monitor more patients simultaneously.</p><br>

## ðŸ’¡Synopsis

The system utilizes YOLOv5, an open-source deep learning model, to detect and classify persons (including patients) in real-time video streams. It then applies optical flow analysis to detect movement within the patient's area of interest. Optionally, the system can calculate accuracy metrics against ground truth annotations to evaluate detection performance.

## ðŸ”§ Tools and Algos
- **Deep Learning Framework**: `PyTorch` for building and training the deep learning models.
  
- **Object Detection Model**: `YOLOv5` for detecting and classifying individuals in the ICU.
	+ The YOLO algorithm divides the input image into a grid of cells, and for each cell, it predicts the probability of the presence of an object and the bounding box coordinates of the object.

	+ **Why YOLOv5?**
	YOLOv5 can be used to detect and track objects more accurately in real-time video streams, enhancing the effectiveness of identifying moving objects in the ICU room for the "TeleICU-DeepVision" project. It provides precise bounding boxes and class labels, aiding in better analysis and monitoring.

<br>
  
- **Video Processing**: `OpenCV` for capturing, preprocessing, and analyzing video frames.
	+OpenCV, short for Open Source Computer Vision Library, is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library used for real-time operation. Originally developed by Intel.

	+ **Why OpenCV?**
	OpenCV is used for its efficient implementation of image processing algorithms, such as optical flow, which is essential for tracking movement and changes in video streams in the "TeleICU-DeepVision" project. It provides real-time performance and a wide range of tools for computer vision tasks.
  
- **Movement Analysis**: &nbsp;Object movement based on `Optical flow algorithms` for detecting and tracking patient movements.
	+Optical flow is one of the efficient approaches to track the movement of objects. Optical flow studies the relative motion of objects across different frame sequences based on the velocity of movement of objects and illumination changes.

	+ **Why Optical flow?**
	Object movement based on optical flow is used to detect and track subtle patient movements and interactions in the ICU room, which is crucial for continuous monitoring and early intervention. It provides detailed motion analysis, enhancing the accuracy of patient activity recognition in the "TeleICU-DeepVision" project.
